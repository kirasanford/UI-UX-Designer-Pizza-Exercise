## **Research & Insight Document**

**The purpose of this research is to find the best way to design a pizza management application based on the provided user stories.**    
   1. Assumptions  
      1. The user stories do not mention customers meaning this is an internal application used to plan signature pizzas.   
      2. The user stories do not mention analytics, pricing, or any other business features. Therefore, this will focus solely on pizzas.  
      3. Users should not be able to double up on toppings.  
2. **Research Objectives**  
   1. Due to time, I was not able to create surveys or interview pizzeria owners or chefs. But I consulted friends who frequently order pizza or have experience in the restaurant industry.  
   2. Questions asked:  
      1. What is your favorite place to order pizza?  
      2. What are your thoughts on the build your own pizza option? What do you like about it? What would you change?  
3. **Methodology**  
   1. Research type: Research consisted of casual interviews.   
   2. Participants: College and former college students- some of which who have worked in the restaurant industry- between the ages 22-27  
4. **Research Findings**  
   1. User Profiles   
      1. Persona 1: Pizza Store Owner  
         1. Demographics: Aged 30-55, business owners, often multitasking  
         2. Goals: As a pizza store owner, I should see a visually appealing dashboard to manage toppings.  
         3. Pain Points: easy to identify topping, making alterations should be intuitive, clear feedback for duplicate toppings.  
      2. Persona 2: Pizza Chef  
         1. Demographics: Aged 18-55, employee, often moving quickly  
         2. Goals: As a chef, I should see a visually appealing dashboard to manage toppings.  
         3. Pain Points: differentiate between pizzas, straightforward alteration process, clear feedback for duplicate pizzas.  
   2. User Needs  
      1. Functional Needs  
         1. Easy navigation to manage toppings and various pizzas.  
         2. Clear visibility of duplicate pizza names AND duplicate toppings.  
      2. Emotional Needs  
         1. Assurance that the system is consistently accurate.  
         2. A need for minimizing confusion for a smooth, efficient workflow.  
      3. Contextual Needs  
         1. Should be accessible on various devices (tablets, phones, computers)  
   3. Insights  
      1. Key Insights:  
         1. Almost every user orders via their phones and usually prefer the website over the app.  
         2. Many users like seeing everything at once.  
         3. Customers will ignore a clunky design if the pizza is good. (Unimportant to this UI, but may be important in the future.)  
      2. Pain Points: Users need an intuitive and quick way to create signature pizzas. There should also be a clear way to identify different pizzas through unique names.  
5. Competitive Analysis  
   I looked at common places people mentioned to see what their pizza builders were like. Taking inspiration from what users enjoy and finding ways to improve on it to meet the current user stories.  
   1. Dominos  
      1. Users like the clear visual **and** written description of the pizza. Though not every customization option has a visual representation.
   1. Oreganos/ Fly bye  
      1. The UI is very similar for both websites.Intuitive and modern design with an easy way to identify which toppings are selected, but there isn’t an option to double up.
   1. Zeek’s Pizza/Barro’s  
     1. The UI is visually similar. Despite this, Barro’s website is very difficult to navigate on mobile, while Zeek’s does not have that issue. Both seem to prioritize functionality over visuals, leaving them feeling overall clunky; especially with the long list of toppings.
6. Recommendations  
   1. Design Recommendations: There is always a visually clear way to indicate when a topping is selected. For doubling up on toppings, the option is hidden until the user selects the option.  
   2. Feature Prioritization: Domino’s has both a strong visual and functional design giving it a unique, more accessible, and modern edge over other websites.  
7. Conclusion  
   1. The pizza management app needs to be visually appealing and easily accessible. It should streamline the process of creating pizzas by clearly showing the pizza being made and prevent duplicate names. Users should also be able to see a list of all pizzas and be able to navigate that list to view and edit any pizza from the list.

12. Documentation   
    1. I aimed to create a simple and intuitive design. I kept the color palette to grays, whites mostly. I used pizza dough tan for the background to help center the pizza theme and greens for buttons as they are associated with good and pizzas (green peppers, oregano, and basil).  
    2. Owners access the list of signature pizzas by clicking the hamburger icon in the top right corner—mirroring the typical customer experience of viewing their order on a pizza website. This design choice streamlines navigation while also subtly emphasizes the customer perspective, helping owners get in the right headspace.  
    3. To continue the customer first mindset, the figma prototype was designed around mobile as almost every person I interviewed orders pizza from their phone. The mockup was also designed with a mobile first mindset.  
    4. The UI follows the natural pizza-making process to create familiarity: sauce, cheese, and toppings. And by keeping everything on one page, pizza store owners have the flexibility to assemble their pizzas however they feel most comfortable with.  
    5. In case a signature pizza requires a specific kind of cheese such as a vegan pizza or a 3 cheese pizza, I included picking cheeses as part of the process, with solely mozzarella selected by default.
    6. To enhance accessibility, I implemented a dynamic pizza similar to Domino's pizza builder that changes to match the user’s selections including the selected sauce, cheeses, and toppings. The toppings are color coordinated and set to a fixed position so as the user gets more familiar, they are rewarded with a sense of accomplishment by being able to identify the toppings quicker. To be more accessible for color blind users, there is also a written summary of the pizza. With Figma, I am unfortunately limited to the free version and was not able to replicate this design. To make sure the Figma version is equally as accessible, I took inspiration from Mountain Mike’s and had visual representations of the toppings next to its name. This was not replicated with the cheese section due to difficulties finding a visual way to represent the differences.
    7. Most pizza websites have a very large quantity of toppings. For the sake of time, I prioritized proof of concept over stress testing. Meats are on the left and non-meats are on right; both columns are in alphabetical order. If there were more than 20 toppings I would separate them into 2 sections instead of 2 columns.
    8. I included a special notes section for unique cases the UI is not set up for; For example, a Valentine's day pizza in the shape of a heart.
    9. The user stories stressed the importance of clear indicators for repeated pizza names. For the HTML, CSS, I had pop ups appear as feedback when the user hits submit. It is a simple and effective way to ensure that every pizza has a unique name.
13. If given more time  
    1. I would have developed a mock up of the pizza list page as well matching what was originally drawn in the wireframe. I would have also liked to use actual pictures of the toppings instead of colored circles on the pizza display.  
    2. I would have included more toppings approaching closer to 20 instead of the initial 6\.
